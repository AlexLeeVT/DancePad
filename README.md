## Project Overview
Logitech Lighspeed is a technology that advertises that it's devices has less than 1ms latency while retaining a long battery life of 10-30 hours. A generic solution that can be built by the average hobbyist or student is not yet widely available. This project seeks to create a framework and example for other projects that have use of this type of technology. The design is implemented in a dance pad for entertainment as a controller on PC to show the capabilities. 

## Educational Value Added

The students learn how to create efficient low power embedded systems that utilize the nrf24L01+ transciever and LiPo batteries.
